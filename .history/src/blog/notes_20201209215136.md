blog Directory Data File

we haven't designated that our new blog post should use the post layout.

One other way we can use our data directory file is to set an altered permalink structure.

"Permalink" is the term for the URL path that follows your domain (maybe you've also heard this called a "slug").

## collections.

Collections are groups of related content created by adding tags.
